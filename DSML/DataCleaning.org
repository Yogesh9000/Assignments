#+title: Data Cleaning

* What is data cleaning?
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing *incorrect*, *corrupted*, *incorrectly* *formatted*, *duplicate*, or *incomplete* data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct.

* What is the difference between data cleaning and data transformation?
Data cleaning is the process that removes data that does not belong in your dataset. Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another. Transformation processes can also be referred to as data wrangling, or data munging, transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format for warehousing and analyzing.
